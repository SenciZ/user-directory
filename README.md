# User Directory Project

The User Directory shows a list of Users and lists their information. You are able to cycle through the different users using the <em>Next</em> and <em>Previous</em> controls. The ability to <strong>Delete</strong> a user is available.

## Purpose Of Project

The purpose of this projects was to practice passing props and lifting state. I concentrated on breaking up the app into reusable components. For example the <em>Previous</em> and the <em>Next</em> controls are created from one component. The 3 buttons which manage the list are also created from only one component. Another React method I tried to implement was Derived State. That is visilble in the <strong>1/25</strong> display in the upper right corner of the item card and is also used throughout other parts of the project.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
